# Example configuration for LACRM Custom Fields Mapping
# Add this section to your config.ini file

[LACRM_CUSTOM_FIELDS]
# Map enriched data fields to LACRM Custom Field IDs
# You need to create these custom fields in LACRM first, then get their IDs

# Basic company information
brreg_navn = YOUR_FIELD_ID_HERE        # Official company name from Brønnøysund
bransje = YOUR_FIELD_ID_HERE           # Industry/business sector  
antall_ansatte = YOUR_FIELD_ID_HERE    # Number of employees
etablert = YOUR_FIELD_ID_HERE          # Date company was established
nettsted = YOUR_FIELD_ID_HERE          # Company website URL
firma_epost = YOUR_FIELD_ID_HERE       # Company email address

# Analysis and ratings
proff_rating = YOUR_FIELD_ID_HERE      # Financial health rating (Stabil/Risiko/Ukjent)
pipeline_anbefalt = YOUR_FIELD_ID_HERE # Recommended sales pipeline
salgsmotor_notat = YOUR_FIELD_ID_HERE  # AI-generated sales notes and analysis
oppdateringslogg = YOUR_FIELD_ID_HERE  # Update history log

# HOW TO GET FIELD IDs:
# 1. Create the custom fields in LACRM (Settings → Custom Fields)
# 2. Run: python lacrm_sync.py --show-fields
# 3. Copy the Field IDs from the output
# 4. Replace YOUR_FIELD_ID_HERE with the actual IDs

# EXAMPLE (with real Field IDs):
# brreg_navn = 4040978312246995862143020657543
# bransje = 4040978325247338748089826771438
# antall_ansatte = 4040978367411984014571433950341
